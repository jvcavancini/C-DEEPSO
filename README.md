## Instructions

To execute C-DEEPSO+irace, do the following steps:
1) Install R version >=3.2.0
2) Inside R, install the irace package with the command *install.packages("irace")*
3) Go to the folder *tuning*, the file *target-runner-advanced* (an python script), and change the lines 366 and 381 to add the PATH of the *RUN.m* script that is located inside the *tuning* folder
4) Execute *runirace.R*: an R process will open and will do the fine tuning of C-DEEPSO on the 96 instances of the WPP problem. In the end of the process, there will be 96 files called *results_X.rdata*, with X beeing the number of the instance of the problem
5) Run C-DEEPSO: with the parameters generated by *runirace.R* (in the step 4, above), that you will find listed in *results_X.rdata*, you will open matlab and run the *RUN.m* file with this parameters

The computational simulation was done using a Intel i9 3.7 Ghz e 64 GB de RAM on Operational System Ubuntu 20.04.2.0LTS computer.
The code was implemented in Matlab using the MATPOWER package.
The integration of R (4.1.1) and Matlab is done with a Python (3.7) script.
